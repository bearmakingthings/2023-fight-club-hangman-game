This was my final project in my 11th grade computer programming class. It was written in Visual Basic, although I have since lost the source code.
It's a little hangman game with animations I drew myself and a keyboard built into the frame. I only ever compiled and published it because someone online wanted to try my game.

All the clues I wrote were horribly pretentious, and I still feel fondly for it.
